This project leverages the Huge Stock Market Dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical daily prices and volumes for all U.S. stocks and ETFs. The objective is to build a predictive model that can forecast stock prices based on historical data, helping users to better understand trends and potential future market movements.

The project uses machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the price movement of various stocks. It explores data pre-processing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
